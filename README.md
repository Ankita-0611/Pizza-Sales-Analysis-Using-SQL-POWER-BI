# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL-POWER-BI
# Overview
This project is focused on examining key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizing different facets of our pizza sales data to gain a deeper understanding of our business performance. The goal is to compute crucial metrics and develop charts that reveal trends and patterns in the sales data.
# KPI Requirements
## Metrics
1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
5. Average Pizza per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
# Chart Requirements
## Visualizations

   on a daily basis.
2. Monthly Trend for Total Orders: A line chart illustrating the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart allows us to identify peak hours or periods of high order 
   activity.
3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: A pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart provides insights into the popularity of various 
   pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
4. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: A pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart helps us understand customer preferences for pizza 
   sizes and their impact on sales.
5. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: A funnel chart presenting the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart allows us to compare the sales performance of 
   different pizza categories.
6. Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders: A bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders. This chart 
   helps us identify the most popular pizza options.
7. Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders: A chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders. This chart 
   enables us to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.
